              I believe that, unless you complete your school education, you cannot get yourself enrolled into a college. College is highly significant to succeed and achieve your dreams. With higher education, you can get a good job and lead a better life. Without academic career, you will not be able to make a living for yourself, unless you are one of the very few exceptions.

                    <p>This includes using AI for speech recognition or translation, greater levels of factory automation, facial recognition, or even analysis and behavioral forecasting in the legal tech, finance, med tech, and other fields. The fact is that AI can help people improve as individuals. However, if old habits die hard, old beliefs die even harder: altering our behavior and forming new habits is difficult, even when the advantages are obvious. It is not much simpler to free ourselves from science fiction presumptions. The fact is that we need AI to help us develop into healthier, more productive people who can make better decisions with more knowledge and data. Most genuine AI provides feedback loops for individualized usage. Only considering the "dangers" or "benefits," the good or bad, simply puts us in a passive mindset and makes us believe that we are powerless over our own actions, when in fact, this new wave of technology and the development of quantum computing will greatly increase and multiply our abilities as people.</p>

                    <p>Climate change is another issue where I believe artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to rescue the planet since, in the future, it may be able to identify its origins and gradually slow down its effects. I believe that although people are aware of climate change, they don't actually give it much attention. I believe AI can assist to fix it because of this.
                    Some issues with this include the possibility that we won't be able to stop climate change at all because it is already too late or because not enough people are willing to alter their lives to benefit the environment. I'm hopeful that we can slow down climate change before it's too late.

                    <p>Will a robot replace me at work?  Millions of people worry about losing their employment to computers, and many have already experienced this in their lives. One of the greatest enablers of such change is artificial intelligence (A.I.). With developments in artificial intelligence, many industries will face a diminishing workforce  but there are some industries that don’t actually have the workforce to sustain activity, where A.I. can be massively beneficial. One such case, discussed in the aforementioned series, is the trucking  industry. The harsh realities of long-haul trucking are forcing professional drivers to look for work elsewhere, leaving a 50,000 driver shortage in the US alone. Artificial intelligence can be used to bridge this gap. Long-haul trucking can be dangerous and boring — a perfect fit for automation. You might even say that A.I. is not taking away jobs, but relieving drivers of jobs they simply don’t want to do.</p>

The study involving robotics had been greatly majored, scientists started to analyze, observe, create, and work on this digital human-like copy of oneself. Artificial Intelligence of also known as A. I. was given birth to inventions and developments were created in order to help humankind in different aspects. Machine Learning, algorithm, computer vision, and big data, became the new trend and vocabulary. With A.I. Machines were taught, and became smart. Machines were simulated with intelligent behaviors. Cooperation between human and machine became possible, thanks to A. I.

The human body is not infallible, but through the wonders of A.I. research scientists are finding ways to address those imperfections. A.I. has the potential to heal, enhance and make up for the things our bodies lack. The episode follows the heart-rending story of athlete Tim Shaw. In 2013, the former NFL superstar was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis – otherwise known as ALS. ALS is a rare neurological disease that often gets progressively worse over time. In Shaw's case, it led to the end of his athletic career, and eventually the loss of his ability to speak and walk. Despite all this hardship, Shaw has been able to regain a sense of normalcy with the help of A.I.

                    <p>I have always wondered whether other intelligent life exists in this galaxy, but for the first time we have the technology to help answer that question. With artificial intelligence, researchers have renewed the hunt for alien life in space and also begun to wonder if an entirely new life form has been born on earth.
 44 TB of new data are gathered every day in just one institute that focuses on finding alien life. This volume of data cannot be analyzed by humans. Because of this, intelligent machines are guiding us, illuminating the route, and greatly enhancing the effectiveness of our quest.
